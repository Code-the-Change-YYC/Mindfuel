# Introduction

## About the Project
The Wonderville Activity Board was built by a team from [Code the Change YYC](https://www.codethechangeyyc.ca/) in collaboration with [Wonderville](https://wonderville.org/). Wonderville is is an education technology non-profit focusing on STEM learning products for children in K-12. The Activity Board was created as a tool for location-based viewing of both historical and realtime users of Wonderville's online products. The project is composed of a React frontend, Go REST backend and a MongoDB database; all of which are containerized with Docker. More information on each service can be found in the upcoming sections.
